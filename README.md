## Making a Aave Flash Loan

### 1. About Aave

> Aave is an open source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for earning interest on deposits and borrowing assets.

Aave is like a decentralized pseudo-bank. Instead of a central bank that validates all of the transactions, Aave has smart contracts to automated all of this work. Depositors put their tokens into Aave, and begin earning interest on their deposit. Borrowers, on the other hand, will take tokens out of Aave and will begin accruing interest on the amount borrowed. In order to do this, they must be [overcollateralized](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overcollateralization.asp).

There is another method for those that donâ€™t want to deposit tokens into Aave, and just want to borrow. This is the flash loan that this tutorial is about.
